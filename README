vmware-tools-kernup is a script I wrote to re-compile the vmware kernel modules, after a kernal upgrade.
This script will only work if it is run before and after a kernel upgrade. 

Preferably run periodically as a cron job or on system start-up.

This script will also only work if the vmware installation lives in the following directory:
/root/vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl

Script must also be run by root.
